            <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>
            <p>I enjoy studying complex systems and desire to apply my theoretical background to real-world problems, whether in academics, entrepreneurship, or finance. My background is in math, physics, and computer science, and I use these tools to study complex systems. Complex systems are systems made of many parts where system-wide properties emerge beyond individual parts -- think of robotic swarm control, neuroscience, or financial markets. My goal is to find meaningful uses for my theoretical background to serve the most vulnerable in our society. Feel free to reach out if you would like to work together or if you have any ideas to share.</p>
